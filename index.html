    <h1>My TOP 10 Favorite Treats</h1>

    <h2>10. Fruit</h2>

      <p>This may be controversial but fruit should be a dessert! Or at least a treat. They are refreshing and sweet, what else defines a dessert?</p>
    <h2>9. Frosting</h2>

      <p>Frosting is great to eat on its own. Who needs actual cake? It can be quite sweet but is not something I would skip out on.</p>
    <h2>8. Brownies</h2>
